# VICE
## Visual Implicit Comparative Evaluation

VICE is a dataset derived from the Natural Language for Visual Reasoning v2 (NLVRv2) dataset. We extract image pairs directly from NLVRv2 and enhance them with our own custom annotations, including questions and answers specifically designed for implicit comparative visual reasoning tasks.

## Dataset Overview

The VICE dataset is built upon the foundation of NLVRv2 by:
1. Extracting pairs of images from the original NLVRv2 dataset
2. Annotating these image pairs with new questions that require implcit comparative reasoning
3. Providing answers that demonstrate implicit visual comparison capabilities

## Purpose

This dataset is intended to support research in visual reasoning that requires understanding relationships between multiple images, particularly focusing on implicit comparative evaluation skills.

## Citation

If you use the VICE dataset in your research, please cite both this repository and the original NLVRv2 dataset.
