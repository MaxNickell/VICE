# VICE
## Visual Implicit Comparative Evaluation

VICE is a dataset derived from the Natural Language for Visual Reasoning v2 (NLVRv2) dataset. We extract image pairs directly from NLVRv2 and enhance them with our own custom annotations, including questions and answers specifically designed for implicit comparative visual reasoning tasks.
